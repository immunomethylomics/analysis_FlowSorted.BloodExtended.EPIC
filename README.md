Code for the analysis included in the manuscript. Data is available on GEO or ArrayExpress.
The analysis comprises the selection of the library.
Training/testing of the libraries
External validation (adult, umbilical cord samples).
Validation using independent artificial mixtures.
Applications.

Code includes figures in the paper (QC8a.Rmd) and additional analyses (Ext_Suppl_Code.Rmd) performed for the QC of the data. All the figures were knitted using the original objects.



Data availability: The main source dataset (12 cell types, testing and training artificial mixtures) is hosted on GSE167998 . The Superseries is under the code GSE181034 . This is composed of the following series: GSE180683 (glioma samples, validations for T cell memory subsets), GSE180970 (umbilical cord artificial mixtures), GSE182379 (independent validation 12 cell-types artificial mixtures).  Additional datasets analyzed in this manuscript are publicly available in GEO and ArrayExpress with accession numbers: GSE110554, GSE77797, GSE110530, GSE35069, GSE68456, GSE88824, GSE42861, GSE140038, GSE161778, GSE105018, E-MTAB-7069, GSE85042, GSE103189, GSE104778, GSE62219, GSE87571, E-MTAB-7309, GSE87571, GSE12163.
